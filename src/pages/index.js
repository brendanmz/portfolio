            I am a self-taught web developer from Canada and am very excited
            about all the creative possibilities there are in modern web
            development. I have been studying Front-end development through an
            open-source project called The Odin Project and have also worked as
            a PHP/JS Programmer at GoOut s.r.o..
          </P>
          <P>
            I have a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Music Performance with a focus on
            engineering and music production. Due to COVID my hours have been
            severely reduced at GoOut s.r.o. and have been actively seeking a
            Junior Front-end position with React. I have a lot to learn but I
            have been taking lessons/pair programming with a senior developer
            friend of mine for the past month as well as self-studying for ~15
            hours/wk for the past 3 months.

            My current preferred stack is: React, Redux + Redux Toolkit,
            styled-components, react-router-dom, formik, eslint, prettier.
          </P>
          <P>
            I am interested in continuing my learning in web development. As a
            Junior developer I expect to spend a lot of time making mistakes and
            having to recover fast, but this is a cycle I have become very used
            to in both my self-study and my lifetime of musical practice.
